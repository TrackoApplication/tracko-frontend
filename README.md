## Introduction

Welcome to our project management component! This individual module focuses on efficient Backlog Management, encompassing Issues and Sprints for streamlined project development. 

**Issues**

Our Issues feature allows users to create detailed problem statements, specifying the project and issue type (Story, Bug, Epic). Users fill in key fields such as Summary, Description, Sprint, Epic, Assignee, and Reporter. Testing requirements and story points for both development and testing can be entered, with the system automatically calculating total story points. Administrators can manage Create Issue permissions. Created issues are listed in the Backlog, where modifications like adding child issues, and updates or deletions can be performed.

**Sprint**

The Sprint functionality empowers users to create sprints from the Backlog. Upon creation, a Sprint Backlog is displayed, where users can drag and drop issues from the Backlog. Starting the sprint involves entering details like Sprint Name, Duration, Start and End dates, and Sprint goal. The sprint becomes visible on the Kanban board, and users can complete it at the end of the defined duration. Incomplete issues seamlessly transition to the next/new sprint or back to the Backlog. Manage sprint-related permissions (Create/Update/Delete) efficiently with project admin controls.

Experience enhanced project management with our powerful Backlog and Sprint features!
